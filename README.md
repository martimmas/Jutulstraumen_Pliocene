# Model configuration files for Mas e Braga et al. (2023, Comms Earth & Environment)

This repository contains three folders:

- **InputAC:** inverted fields for basal sliding (FC*) and ice rheology (FA*) used in each experiment
- **meshes:** mesh files for the different domains (and refinements) used in each experiment
- **runs:** folders with all runs performed
    - `jutul_slope_*` refers to the smaller domain, focused on Jutulstraumen
    - `jutul_vest_*` refers to the larger domain, which encompasses Veststraumen
    - `*_pli_*` denotes experiments for the Jutulstraumen domain under Pliocene forcing
    - `*_pd_ref_*` refers to the control present-day simulations
    - `*_proj_*` denotes experiments using modern-day subglacial topography and different basal melting and sea-level rise scenarios


The source and DOIs for all climate forcing and topography datasets used are listed on the main paper.
